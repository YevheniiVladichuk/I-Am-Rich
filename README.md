# I Am Rich

I've started new ios development study course by Udemy today. So as repeat is the best learning, I'm not disdaining to do the the simple task. The fist of it was very simple one page app named "I Am Rich", which was created in 2008 year. This app price was 999$ and it did nothing, just only illustrates its owners' ability to purchase thousand-dollar apps. The app was pulled from Apple Store after less than 24 hours, only eight copies were sold. In the years since, several similar applications have been released at lower prices. 

The task of module was repeat this app with storyboard, I did it throught code.
